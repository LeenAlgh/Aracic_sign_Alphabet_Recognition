# Arabic Sign Language Alphabet Recognition ðŸ¤ŸðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¦

A deep learning-based system for recognizing Arabic Sign Language alphabets using sequential models. This project explores the performance of LSTM and GRU models in classifying hand gestures from webcam-captured images.

---

## Project Overview

This system translates Arabic Sign Language **alphabet** into text by recognizing static hand gestures. The dataset was collected manually in real time and includes **400 images per class**, covering **all 28 Arabic letters + 1 for "Ù„Ø§" (no)**.

## ðŸ§ª Models Used

We trained and compared the performance of:
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**

Each model was trained on time-series features extracted from image sequences to enhance temporal pattern recognition in gesture data.
